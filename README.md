# Inconsistent Styling in Tailwind CSS due to Class Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes difficult-to-debug issue in Tailwind CSS: inconsistent styling due to incorrect class usage or unexpected conflicts with other CSS rules. The problem often arises when multiple classes are applied, leading to unforeseen behavior.  The solution focuses on identifying and resolving such conflicts.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases an example of inconsistent styling. The text within the div should have a specific style applied by Tailwind classes, but due to a conflict (which might be in another CSS file), the rendering is not as expected.  This might be due to class name typos, overwriting styles, specificity issues, or unexpected interactions with other CSS frameworks.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents a resolution by correcting the class names or modifying the styles. This involves carefully checking for typos, ensuring correct class ordering (most specific first), and potentially using the `!important` flag sparingly only when absolutely necessary and understanding its implications.  Also, examining any other CSS stylesheets or plugins interacting with the same elements would be beneficial for debugging.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a development server (if applicable). 
3. Observe the unexpected styling in the application. 
4. Refer to the solution file for debugging strategies and the correction.
